# iOS Programming Challenge

#### Requirements

Calculate and display each Fibonacci number from 1 to max N on an iPhone with unsigned integers, and display each F(n) in a table view.  The UITableView scrolling __MUST__ remain smooth.

The formula for calculating a Fibonacci number is: 

```
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```

The user will need to type in the max N everytime the app is shown. You are free to modify the app's views any way you want, but be mindful of performance and user experience.
